## What's up?

You are a brave knight who wants to join his beloved princess to kiss her. But the king doesn't agree. Actually he doesn't like you…

You crossed the mountain and defeated the terrible dragon with your Kalashnikov to prove him you can take care of his daughter. You are right now on your way back…

Move with arrows on your keyboard, click to shoot.
You have to avoid all the sh** the king's soldiers are sending to kill you. You can shoot the blocks to move or destroy them.
Sometimes your fairy godmother will give you a bonus card, but sometimes she's drunk and it won't be a bonus.
Show the king that you can escape this by scoring the maximum.

Good luck.
